# Declarative UI Demo

Declarative UI Demo

## About

Flutter is an excellent tool to __quickly__ build high quality product experiences. The speed is largely due to the framework\'s decision to implement a declarative approach toward building the presentation layer. The declarative model is perhaps more a intuitive and straight forward way of building front-end experiences than the imperative paradigm. By way of example, HTML is declarative while C is imperative. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the world wide web became so popular?
